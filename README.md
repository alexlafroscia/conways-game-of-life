Conway's Game of Life
=======================

This is my implementation of Conway's Game of Life, using React.js to render the
cells in real time.  It's my first React project, created partly to try out
React and partly to complete the algorithm after learning about it at the [2014
Global CodeRetreat](http://coderetreat.org/events/event/listByType?type=gdcr14).

You can check out the project
